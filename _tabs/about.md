### What is this place? 

Hello, my name is Braden Jaime Lubrani, but I prefer Jaime :) 

This is mainly a professional, personal website, if that makes sense. It's meant to showcase some personal projects that I'm working on that I think have professional applications. 

Anything goes, but it's mainly programming and cybersecurity stuff. 

Thanks for taking the time to look at this :D
